# URL-Analyzer
A small, purpose-built launcher for safely analyzing suspicious URLs and files using an isolated Firefox 52 environment. The script wraps Firefox in Firejail, optionally cuts network access, and captures traffic to a PCAP when needed, making it easy to inspect browser behavior without contaminating the host. Designed for quick, repeatable analysis with minimal setup.
